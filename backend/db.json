The courses present students with tools of inquiry from multiple liberal arts disciplines to make known tremendous diversities and overlapping histories and experiences within the wider black world. AA&AS also offers two African languages, Swahili (spoken throughout East, Central, and South Africa) and Somali, in its undergraduate curriculum. The major curriculum consists of three core courses and seven upper-division elective courses. Many AA&AS graduates have not only been accepted to professional and graduate schools, but have also cultivated their career paths in exciting directions including education, business, medicine, law, the arts, journalism, local and transnational advocacy work, and foreign affairs.

opportunity to develop professional educator skills. Professional courses in education and agricultural education prepare students to become effective and successful educators. Experiential learning is emphasized as students spend time in schools applying course concepts, learning from effective educators, and completing a teaching internship as a capstone activity.\n\nWhile the major is focused on teaching school-based agricultural education, graduates are prepared for a variety of careers within the food and agricultural industry. Students are equipped with communication, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills; experience in the teaching and learning process; and a breadth of knowledge of the science and business of agriculture that are in demand by a wide range of employers.\n\nGraduates take positions as agricultural education teachers or youth educators; educational and training specialists for agribusinesses, commodity organizations, extension, and nonprofits; as well as positions in sales, management, and customer relations with agribusinesses.\n\nStudents graduating in agricultural education are in demand by employers, very satisfied in their careers, and earn some of the highest average starting salaries among College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS) majors. However, there are not enough graduates to meet the current demand for school-based agricultural education teachers. This demand is predicted to increase in the future, both in Minnesota and across the United States.\n\nStudents are prepared to meet teacher licensure requirements in Agricultural Education (grades 5-12) and Coordinator of Work-Based Learning (grades 9-12). The agricultural education major is a collaborative partnership between the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS) and the College of Education and Human Development (CEHD).","cdProgramAccreditedNextRev":"2023-08-11","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second

Studies is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of American Society. The program provides a broad, interdisciplinary approach to the study of critical issues to American society, with an emphasis on deep historical, cultural, and political understandings. Faculty in the program come from a range of fields and have varied expertise.\n\nStudents majoring in American Studies undertake a unique, interdisciplinary study of American society, gaining critical perspectives on past and contemporary issues and topics. They typically pursue their own interests within the very broad range of educational opportunities in the program. Courses offered by the department explore a wide range of topics, including popular culture, politics, migration, religion, history, race, gender, and sexuality, as well as important issues such as America's changing place in the world, foreign policy, the events of 9/11, and economic crises and inequality.\n\nMajoring in American Studies provides an opportunity for students to pursue particular interests while gaining broad training in a variety of topics and interdisciplinary scholarship. The program of study provides opportunities for the development of writing, critical and creative thinking, and research skills, which culminate in the Senior Project. The Senior Seminar is a year-long course of study limited to graduating seniors in American Studies, giving a chance for undergraduates to work closely with the faculty member in developing and undertaking a major research project which serves as the capstone for the undergraduate program. This unique process allows students to use their skills and knowledge to conduct original research or creative work, which reflects their interests and expertise on a particular topic.\n\nIn addition, the Department of American Studies cooperates with the Departments of African-American and African Studies, American Indian Studies, Chicano & Latino Studies, and Asian American Studies, which makes it possible for students to concentrate their studies in one of those cultural areas.\n\nAmerican Studies provides a unique preparation for students interested in an interdisciplinary approach to a particular aspect of American society, while preparing them for careers or further graduate training. The program encourages service learning, internships, and partners with the Minnesota Historical Society to place undergraduates into working on and researching public history. Graduates are well prepared for work in the public and private sector, as well as nonprofit and non-governmental organizations. Current alumni work in a range of fields including education, non-profits, research, historical preservation, journalism, mass media, law, and medicine.\n\nTransfer students interested in American Studies should contact the Department of American Studies to discuss previous coursework, transfer credits, and likely course of study at Minnesota. Students wishing to double major or minor should also contact the department about developing a course of study and graduation plan.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramLOs":"new test","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Communications, Languages, and Cultural Studies","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"33","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"33","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Am Stdy","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10949"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10949"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10949","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"05.0102","id":"005620217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706127974799,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049753,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"American Studies B A","name":"American Studies B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"005620217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"005620217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

It comprises four primary subfields: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology, all of which are uniquely linked by the concept of culture.  \n\nAnthropology combines a set of theories and methods that have, at their core, the development of an understanding of human biological and cultural variability. It allows students to learn about the scientific, social, political, and historical perspectives on human variation and human evolution. It challenges them to examine their own beliefs, and come to their own conclusions, about the implications in today's world of biological and cultural variation, including how false narratives have been and continue to beperpetuated in order to oppress certain groups. Fundamentally, Anthropology therefore contributes to the liberal education of students at the University of Minnesota by tackling questions that are at the heart of societal tensions: how does identity relate to the biological and cultural factors that have shaped humans as a species, and that continue to shape populations and individuals? Importantly, Anthropology as a reflexive discipline also examines its own legacy.  Many of our classes tackle the impact of colonialism, racism, and other actions and ideologies that serve to justify and perpetuate inequality.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science degree recognizes that many fields of study within biological anthropology and archaeology depend upon modes of inquiry based upon empirical scientific methods. It therefore develops competence in these scientific methods through curricular requirements within and outside Anthropology. Students pursuing this degree are required to take 20-24 credits outside Anthropology in a wide variety of courses within the Quantitative and Natural sciences. Within the major, students take numerous lab-based courses, in which they learn to ask scientific questions, design a research methodology, collect and analyze data, and use the results to refine the question. Non lab-based classes also strongly emphasize research skills, effective writing, and critical thought. \n\nThe BS degree provides an excellent foundation for a wide range of careers in anthropology, such as evolutionary anthropology, molecular anthropology, geo-archaeology, archaeological chemistry, and forensic anthropology.\n\nAdditionally, the BS degree enables students who are pursuing a career in the health sciences to fulfill the math and science prerequisites for medical school and other graduate programs in health, while gaining a solid foundation in anthropology. Although a second language is not required for the BS degree, cultural competency and an appreciation of the role of culture in how societies construct knowledge are gained through anthropological coursework at all levels.\n","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"55","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Anth","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10950"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10950"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10950","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":false,"saaWhifDispPrem":false,"saaWhifDispStd":false,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1229","hegisCode":"45.0201","id":"008020117-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1697728671449,"lastEditedBy":"norma240@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049753,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Anthropology B S","name":"Anthropology B.S.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"008020117","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"008020117","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"The major designator for the Anthropology BS is ANTH.\n<br>\n<br>At least 14 upper-division credits in the major must be taken at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus.\n<br>\n<br>Students may earn a B.S., B.A. or a minor in anthropology, but cannot earn more than one major or minor in anthropology. \n<br>\n<br>All incoming CLA first-year (freshmen) must complete the First-Year Experience course sequence. \n<br>\n<br>All incoming CLA first-year (freshmen) students earning a BA, BS, or BIS degree must complete the second-year career management course CLA 3002.\n<br>\n<br>All students must complete a capstone in at least one CLA major.

It is the study of who we are, and how we came to be that way. Anthropology is partly a natural science, partly a social science, and partly a humanistic study. Anthropology majors compare and contrast the biological, social, and cultural similarities and differences of humans and their societies across the globe and develop a sophisticated understanding of both the cultural diversity and the biological unity of our species. Perhaps more than with any other degree, Anthropology majors are known to possess unique observational and critical thinking skills, and are aware of the role that culture plays in identity, relationships, and decision-making.\n\nStudents who major in the field are expected to take courses in the four sub-fields of anthropology. Students planning a professional career in anthropology general specialize in one of the sub-fields: biological anthropology (the evolutionary history of human and nonhuman primates), archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic societies through their material culture), sociocultural anthropology (the study of the behavior of recent people in settings that range from unindustrialized societies to modern urban centers), and linguistic anthropology (the comparative study of languages and communication). The Anthropology Department website (http://cla.umn.edu/anthropology/ba-anthropology) offers several examples of course sequences designed to provide training in particular sub-fields. There are a variety of opportunities for graduates with degrees in anthropology. While some go on to graduate school in order to obtain a position in a university, most graduates find non-academic jobs in the private and public sectors. Private industry consulting, environmental firms, product development and marketing firms, as well as the nonprofit sector all employ anthropologists because of the unique observational and critical thinking skills they possess. Governmental agencies at the state and federal levels seek anthropologists for various positions. Biological anthropologists find employment as forensic scientists working for law enforcement. Archaeologists find jobs in cultural resource management (CRM) firms whose services are contracted by construction companies to ensure compliance with legislation pertaining to archaeological and historical preservation. \n\nAn anthropology major is also excellent preparation for professional schools in medicine, public health, nursing, and law. An anthropology major offers a holistic education that, regardless of the job attained after graduation, provides a perspective on humanity that inspires a lifetime of engagement with the issues of importance to our globalized society.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"35","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"35","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Anth","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10950"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10950"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10950","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"45.0201","id":"008020217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706128000204,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049753,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Anthropology B A","name":"Anthropology B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"008020217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"008020217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

","cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramDescr":"The bachelor of science (with a major in architecture) is a pre-professional architecture degree program that offers studio-based design education and a rigorous program of history/theory and building technology courses. The program exposes students to the formal, socio-cultural, material, environmental, and historical factors that shape built environments. The BS program fosters a sense of stewardship for local and global built environments by providing opportunities for students to engage with College of Design faculty and research centers, to enroll in service learning courses, and to study abroad. Design education in the BS program is structured around five sequential semester-long design studios. Each studio is a focused study in one of architecture's core areas: 1. material assemblies, 2. site and the designed environment, 3. program and typology, 4. metropolitan design, and 5. advanced design. Through hands-on making and complementary courses, students demonstrate how these core areas affect formal, spatial, and experiential qualities of architectural space. \n\nBS students develop visual literacy through design thinking and the development of design processes in design studios by engaging spatial representation in drawing and computational courses, by researching historical precedents and theoretical texts in history and theory seminars, and by exploring concepts of sustainability and resilience in technology courses. The BS program fosters a sense of stewardship of local and global built environments by providing opportunities for students to engage with College of Design faculty and research centers, to engage in design-build activities, to enroll in service learning courses, and to study abroad. \n\nStudents are eligible to apply to the BS degree program from within the College of Design after completing all required first-year courses. Admission is competitive, with a portfolio, transcripts, and an essay included in the application process. Students in the BS will take five required 6-credit design studios, a sequence of history/theory and building technology courses, and 9 credits of upper-level architecture electives. Graduates of the BS are well prepared to apply to the second year of the School of Architecture's master's of architecture graduate program; master's of science degree programs in sustainability, heritage preservation and conservation, and metropolitan design; as well as other graduate degree programs at peer institutions, per their admissions requirements.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"96","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Architectu","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10827"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TALA -

The curriculum emphasizes concepts and methods from economics and business management and their use in identifying, analyzing, and solving management problems related to food, agriculture, natural resources, and economic development. The program provides a balance between applied economics and business management studies, with a limited amount of applied science. Students may elect a variety of courses or minors in their junior and senior years to accommodate special interests and career goals.\n\nGraduates of the curriculum are prepared for a wide range of employment opportunities in the food system and other agribusinesses. Examples of employment areas include finance and banking, management, input, commodity and food marketing, sales, administration, public and industrial relations, production management, economic and statistical analysis, managerial accounting, management information systems, and supply chain management.\n\nStudents completing the program may also pursue graduate studies in preparation for research, teaching, or continuing education positions in academic institutions, government agencies, or industry. \n\nStudents completing the agricultural food and business management major are not eligible to add a second major in applied economics due to course overlap.\n\nStudents majoring in agricultural and food business management and applied economics cannot minor in either of the department minors (AFBM or APEC). We highly encourage students to pursue a University-wide minor or, if they are in AFBM, one of the department-specific minors offered through CSOM.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramCollegeApprover":"TCSM - Curtis L.

bachelor of arts (BA) degree program in studio art provides you with thorough training in techniques and theory as well as a sound background in the history and criticism of art.\n\nThe flexibility of this program allows students to acquire relevant skills in related areas, via additional majors or minors. Students who earn a BA can double major in journalism to prepare for a career in media or advertising, or in art history to prepare for a curatorial career, or even in business to prepare for a career in non-profit arts management.\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree program in studio art provides training in fine art techniques and theory. Our BA program emphasizes the development of visual awareness and expression through hands-on involvement in the creative process. In the studio courses, BA students will become familiar with the materials and concepts used to understand the nature of visual language and gain a sense of their own aesthetic voice. In theory courses, students gain an appreciation for the scope of art and how art can be a catalyst for societal change.\n\nFaculty in the Department of Art are all active, working artists and thinkers committed to their students and to diversity of students' histories and experiences. The faculty and curriculum encourage students to take risks, to engage with their communities, and prepare students to use the degree in a variety of arts-related careers. The flexibility of this program allows students to double majors or add a minor in fields such as journalism, communications, psychology, and marketing.\n\nGraduates have gone on to work in visual arts, art therapy, non-profit management, advertising, communications and have successfully completed a variety of graduate programs.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"41","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"44","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Art","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10951"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10951"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10951","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"50.0701","id":"009620217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706128071614,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Art B A","name":"Art B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"009620217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"009620217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Starting from the premise that images, objects, and the built environment speak more directly and deeply about a culture than its written records, our courses prepare students to 'read' and respond to the increasingly visual world in which we live. Through the close study of artworks from different times and places, majors acquire a unique understanding of the world and their place within it.\n\nArt history's interdisciplinary curriculum covers the fine arts as well as visual and material culture more broadly defined: from paintings and sculpture to architecture and urban design; from film and photographs to ceramics and textiles; from scientific illustration and posters to performance art and graffiti. Through engaging with these and other forms of visual and material expression, majors develop crucial, transferable skills: visual analysis and interpretation, original research and careful argumentation, image-based thinking and communication, and clear and persuasive writing in a variety of modes.\n\nArt history majors' ability to critically evaluate sources, sharp communication skills, and nuanced understanding of diverse cultures make them natural creative thinkers, storytellers, and community advocates. Thanks to their powerful skill set, students of art history also go on to enjoy higher job satisfaction and lower unemployment rates over the course of their working lives than peers in vocational tracks.\n\nGraduates pursue careers in range of fields: the visual arts (e.g., art criticism, art appraisal and sales, art therapy, museums, and conservation), humanities (e.g., grant writing, historic preservation, and philanthropy), media and marketing (e.g., advertising, film, and journalism), K-12 and post-secondary education (e.g., teaching and administration), information science and collections management (e.g., libraries and archives in non-profit and corporate contexts), as well as medicine and law.\n\nArt history is the history of humanity's creative expression. Majors are therefore asked to fulfill a selection of distribution requirements, which, together, highlight continuities as well as differences across geographic regions and historical eras. To help students gain a more intimate understanding of the important role artistic processes play in knowledge production, the department also requires majors to take one studio art class.\n\nTypically spanning several centuries and continents, 1xxx-level courses provide a broad orientation to art historical topics and debates. 3xxx-level courses are also appropriate for students new to art history, offering introductions to specific subfields (e.g., the history of Chinese painting, the history of photography, etc.). Courses at the 5xxx-level offer more intimate, seminar-style learning experiences, the opportunity to explore focused topics, and pursue individual research under the guidance of faculty experts. Most courses have no prerequisites.

Some departments and colleges have prerequisite or required courses for concentrations based in those departments and colleges in their BIS program.\n\nFor specific information on proposal procedures and on department and college guidelines, see the Individualized Degree Programs website: https://cla.umn.edu/academics-experience/majors-minors/individualized-degree-programs","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Individually Designed Majors","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"50","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"50","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"B I S ","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10925"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10925"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10925","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"260 - Bachelor of Individualized Studies","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Individualized Studies","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"30.9999","id":"012326017-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706128306418,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Bachelor of Indiv Stdy B I S","name":"Bachelor of Individualized Studies B.I.S.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"012326017","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"012326017","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"Students must complete at least 50 approved credits at or above 3xxx, distributed among the three concentrations.

You will be preparing yourself to work on tissue mechanics problems (e.g., how much does a vessel expand in response to a change in pressure, how much does a heart valve leaflet deflect under a given load, or how much does a tendon stretch given a certain amount of tension) as well as on mechanical aspects of biomaterials selection (e.g., what vascular graft or stent materials would provide a good match to the native tissue?). 2) Kinematics and Biomechanical Design  this area emphasizes the design of biomechanical devices and how linkage systems behave. You will be preparing yourself to work on the design of mechanical systems for biomedical use (e.g., how one should design a knee brace to be as light as possible but still provide the necessary support) and to understand the dynamics of large scale motions (e.g., what causes the characteristic features of the various gait irregularities and how can they be corrected?).<br><br>It is necessary that the engineering and science elective (ESE) courses be technically coherent and that the courses be mainly in engineering and at an advanced level.

They share similar biophysical and mathematical descriptions. Momentum transfer underlies flow fluid in the subject known as fluid mechanics. Applications of fluid mechanics in BME range from predicting blood flow in vessels, to flow of samples in \"lab on chip\" microfluidic systems, to flow of cell culture medium through tissue engineered cartilage in bioreactors. Mass and heat transfer refer to the ability to deliver molecules and energy, respectively, from a source to a target. Applications of mass and heat transfer range from predicting blood oxygenation rates in capillaries from oxygen in lung alveoli and in hollow fibers from pure oxygen gas in \"heart lung machines,\" to movement of mRNA generated in the cell nucleus to cytoplasmic ribosomes. BTP is highly mathematical and computational in nature, since the basis of making such predictions is formulating and solving the equations that govern momentum, mass, and energy balances.

Chicano-Latino studies majors take courses offered in two broadly defined fields of study, humanities and social science. Humanities content includes courses designed to increase awareness of Chicana/o culture, as well as intellectual, aesthetic, literary, historical, ethical, and human values. Social science content includes courses that analyze social institutions and how they affect the individual, as well as emphasize contemporary Chicana/o issues as they relate to the larger society. Areas of study include political science, anthropology, economics, sociology, and history. The bachelor of arts degree in Chicano-Latino studies is designed to meet the needs of students preparing for careers serving Chicana/o-Latina/o constituencies and to prepare students for graduate and advanced professional study in programs in which a minority affairs focus would be an asset. The program allows students the flexibility of pursuing work in related fields, such as Latin American studies, Spanish studies, Women's studies, and American studies.

Civil engineers analyze, design, and supervise the construction of roads, buildings, water supply systems, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and wastewater treatment systems. They must consider many factors in the design process including regulations and policy issues, sustainability, fabrication costs and constructibility, expected lifetime of a project, and risk assessment of natural events and potential hazards. \n\nCivil engineering is a broad area of engineering and has a tangible impact on the quality of life, human health, and safety. The advances that civil engineers have made in providing clean water supply systems have had a greater impact on human health and longevity than many advances in the medical field. The structures we live and work in, the roads and bridges we drive on, the clean water we drink, and wastewater treatment systems we use, are all designed by civil engineers. Major specialties within civil engineering include construction, environmental, geotechnical, municipal, structural, transportation, and water resources engineering. \n\nCivil engineering jobs are available in both the private and public sector through consulting firms and in government agencies at the local, state, and federal levels. Employment can be found in nearly any region, from small communities and remote areas to the largest cities in the world. Graduates of the program have worked on the design of the tallest building and largest dams in the world. Civil engineering is considered to have one of the highest levels of job satisfaction of all professions. Civil engineers can enjoy a fulfilling technical career and also have opportunities for administrative and leadership positions. Many opportunities are available that allow civil engineers to spend time outdoors. The infrastructure required to sustainably maintain modern society ensures the continued demand for civil engineers. \n\nThe upper division civil engineering program requires students to take introductory courses in the major areas. In addition, students may emphasize in an area by selecting appropriate technical electives in consultation with their advisor. The infrastructure required to sustainably maintain modern society ensures the continued demand for civil engineers.\n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,

characterize a well-schooled engineer and citizen; and to provide students with opportunities for research experience in one of the leading computer engineering centers of scholarship.\n\nThe field of computer engineering resulted from the tremendous development of computers and, in particular, the evolution of microprocessors. The design process for almost every electronic system includes the specification and development of the control program for the system's microprocessor. A particular computer engineering job can be more closely related to hardware or software, to functional design or detailed design. The Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree provides the background necessary for persons, with continuing study, to work in many computer engineering subfields. The bachelor's degree itself does not, however, provide highly specialized knowledge in any particular subfield.\n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Math, Engineering, and Science","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"104","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"124","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Compt Eng","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["11122"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TIOT - College of Science and Engineering"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["11122"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"11122","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TIOT - College of Science and Engineering","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Program's Admit Term","degreeDesignation":"261 - Bachelor of Computer Engineering","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TIOT","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TIOT"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Computer Engineering","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"14.0901","id":"018326107-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1698857426331,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"07UGR College of Sci and Engineering","longName":"Computer Engineering B Comp E","name":"Computer Engineering B.Comp.E.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"018326107","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"018326107","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programAdmissionRequirements","label":"Admission Requirements","notes":"Students interested in pursuing a degree in computer engineering or electrical engineering are encouraged to take EE 1001 in their first year.","editorEnabled":false},{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All freshmen in the College of Science and Engineering must complete CSE 1001: First-Year Experience.

The program prepares students for a variety of industrial, governmental, and business positions involving the use of computers, or for graduate work in the field.\n\nThe Computer Science B.A. is a good fit for someone who wants to learn Computer Science + X. It allows room to explore another area of study when compared the technical course heavy Computer Science BS program. The B.A. includes a richer set of elective credits than the B.S. For application areas that involve the liberal arts, this broader background may be more appropriate.

Credits cannot also be applied to the undergraduate degree (i.e., no double dipping). Students should consider taking the following courses/requirements to apply toward their graduate degree as an undergraduate integrated program student (16 credits max):\n<br>\n<br>CSCI 8970 - Computer Science Colloquium (1 credit)\n<br>\n<br>Course to meet the Theory and Algorithms Breadth requirement (3 credits)*\n<br>\n<br>Course to meet the Architecture, Systems, & Software Breadth requirement (3 credits)*\n<br>\n<br>Course to meet the Applications Breadth requirement (3 credits)*\n<br>\n<br>CSCI 5XXX level course that fits your interests and background (3 credits) or an approved graduate level elective or graduate minor course. We recommend waiting to take CSCI 8XXX level courses for your graduate year, but this level of coursework is still available to you if you have the appropriate prerequisites. \n<br>\n<br>CSCI 5XXX level course that fits your interests and background (3 credits) or an approved graduate level elective or graduate minor course.

The department places a particular focus on the power of ideas; we like to think about how abstract questions in philosophy and theory address concrete problems in our material world.\n\nCSCL strives for a broad, international scope, and ranges widely across history and geography.

sustainability of the planet. In short, it is the branch of geoscience that is concerned with the interactions between humans and the geologic environment. The subject covers natural processes that have been modifying the planet over its entire history, but with a strong focus on understanding the modern system and how it has been affected by human activities. Students earning a Major in Environmental Geoscience will develop key observational and analytical skills that enable them to address fundamental questions about the functioning of geoscience systems, especially in relation to hydrology and water quality, soils, mineral resources, and climate change. \n\nThis major is well suited to those interested in pursuing geoscience careers in environmental, geological and hydrogeological consulting, industry, and local, state, and federal government agencies. In addition to acquiring a foundation in the geologic processes that govern water, soil, and natural resource development, students will gain a range of transferable skills, including: written and oral reports; critical analysis and interpretation of data; and group work.","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAccreditedName":"n/a","cdProgramAccreditedAddress":"n/a","cdProgramAccreditedPhone":"n/a","cdProgramAccreditedWebsite":"n/a","cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":true,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseMin":"4","cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"Yes, freshmen and transfer students","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"81","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Env Geosci","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10925"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","TIOT - College of Science and Engineering"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10925","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}]},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1199","hegisCode":"30.4101","id":"026520217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1692180053246,"lastEditedBy":"$integration","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Environmental Geosciences B A","name":"Env Geosci","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"026520217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"026520217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programAdmissionRequirements","label":"Admission Requirements","notes":"Students interested in the Environmental Geosciences as a major may want to consider taking ESCI 1001 or other ESCI 1xxx course. \n<br>","editorEnabled":false},{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Chemistry is a major component in food science because foods and their constituents undergo chemical reactions and interactions during thermal treatment, processing, refrigeration, freezing, storage and in the presence of unique additives or microbes. These chemical reactions and interactions impact flavor, texture, shelf life, and overall consumer acceptability. Microbiology is also key to the food science discipline. Food processing may involve the use of microorganisms as in the production of bread, cheese, yogurt, sauerkraut, and tempeh. On the other hand, control of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms is important to extend a product's shelf life, ensure safety, and prevent foodborne outbreaks. Physics, mathematics, and engineering are applied in food science because foods must be prepared on a large scale utilizing various mechanical and automated procedures to ensure safety and product consistency. In the food science major, students also learn about sensory/consumer science, packaging, nutritional labeling, analytical procedures, as well as government regulations. The food science program is offered through the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramDeliverySite":"No.","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"85","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"87","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Fd Sci","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["11026"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCOA - College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["11026"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"11026","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCOA - College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Program's Admit Term","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCOA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCOA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0709","hegisCode":"01.1001","id":"030820130-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1698857619177,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"30UGR Col of Food, Agr & Nat Res Sci","longName":"Food Science B S","name":"Food Science B.S.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"030820130","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"030820130","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All major requirements must be taken A-F (unless only offered S-N), and students must earn a grade of at least C- or better.

You likely know that French is spoken on 5 continents and is the sixth most-commonly spoken language in the world. Studying French and Francophone Studies at the University of Minnesota takes you far beyond the stereotypes and basics. The major in French and Francophone studies introduces students to world cultures and history, preparing them for our interconnected, global future. The program cultivates students' cultural sophistication and their skills in language, communication, analysis, and argument. It opens doors, strengthens skills vital to today's careers, and helps you to think about many interesting questions and topics in ways you likely have not before.\n\nA major in French combines beautifully with almost any other major on campus. Recent research shows that employers prefer to hire employees who have double-majored, as it often leads to more innovative thinking skills, making you more marketable. French complements many CLA majors, reinforcing the kinds of skills Liberal Arts degrees are rightly heralded for, or it can help develop parallel skills to majors in other colleges (Business, Science, Agriculture, Design), where critical thinking and communication skills can work together with analytical and practical skills developed from the other discipline. We have seen the vast majority of our majors be double majors, and go on to successful careers in international fields, as well as in education, law, medicine, business. These students choose French as a second major, rather than a minor, because it allows them to reach a higher level of language proficiency while achieving a depth of cultural understanding that is not possible in the shorter program.\n\nStudents who come into our department will quickly discover that this idea of combining disciplines is well-entrenched in our faculty and course offerings, which sets us apart from many language departments which focus more on traditional approaches to the discipline. While well-versed in traditional notions of language and culture, with admirable command of the language, its pedagogy and literatures, our faculty are deeply committed to research in fields such as film and the moving image, genocide studies, representations of the body, disability studies, gender and queer studies, migration, and more. Courses cover not only the French language and cultures of Europe, but also of Africa and North America. Elective courses reflect this variety of interests, allowing our students to develop curiosity and knowledge about a wide variety of relevant and current avenues of thought.\n\nSome nuts and bolts: Students must complete FREN 1501/2, and at least four 3xxx-level courses totaling 12 credits, on the UMN TC campus. They can transfer a great deal of coursework from study abroad. We accept appropriate coursework (agreed upon with a departmental advisor before going abroad) from our Montpellier programs, the Senegal MSID program, and others. The majority of our majors do study abroad, if even just in a shorter-term summer program, and these experiences are almost always a life highlight.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Communications, Languages, and Cultural Studies","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"35","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"57","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"FrenStdy","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10962"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10962"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10962","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"16.0901","id":"033620217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706129119141,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"French Studies B A","name":"French Studies B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"033620217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"033620217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programAdmissionRequirements","label":"Admission Requirements","notes":"Complete the introductory 4-semester French language sequence or its equivalent.

The Geography B.S., with its emphasis on the application of scientific knowledge and critical thinking to a wide variety of contemporary geographic problems, is an exceedingly relevant degree. Students specialize in one of two areas, Environmental Geography or Geographic Information Science (GIS). In Environmental Geography students study natural environments and systems, both in themselves and as they relate to human beings, including weather and climate patterns, climate change, plant and animal distributions, forest fires, and natural resources such as water, wind, and forestland. GIS collects geographic information, creates spatial analytical methods, and uses cutting-edge technologies to advance our knowledge of natural and societal phenomena and processes across space and time. Environmental Geography and GIS are highly employable fields that offer opportunities to study some of the most urgent problems facing society today: How do humans affect the climate? Why are climate-change impacts not the same everywhere? What places are most prone to fire, flooding and other hazards, and why? In a city with many different people and many different needs, where is the best place to locate a new hospital or school? How should electoral boundaries be drawn to ensure fair representation? How can we ensure that everyone has access to the goods and services they need or reduce spatial disparities? A B.S. in Geography provides the fundamental knowledge and analytical skills to tackle these and many other fundamentally geographic questions.\n \nThe B.S. in Geography directly benefits from being a science field located in a liberal arts department. As noted by the U.S. National Academies, the liberal arts are of increasing importance in scientific and technical fields because they train students to think broadly and in an integrative way. Geography majors at the University of Minnesota report high rates of satisfaction with the major. The B.S. in Geography supports students in connecting the sciences and the liberal arts by including a broad palette of coursework in Geography such as urban geography, economic geography, and social-cultural geographies. The capstone experience, taken near the end of the student's studies, readies students to move forward by encouraging them to synthesize what they have learned.\n \nA wide variety of career options are open to students with a B.S. in Geography. Local, regional, and federal agencies seek geographers for city and regional planning, natural resource management, transportation, and community development positions. Private industry consulting, environmental and marketing firms, the non-profit sector, and local, national, and transnational non-governmental organizations seek the geographic skills taught in the Geography B.S.

B.A. in Geography answers the need in our society for an integrated, critical understanding of the world's peoples, cultures, and societies, as well as its environments and landscapes, natural and human made -- at every scale from neighborhoods and cities, to nations, regions, and the world as a whole.  Many contemporary issues are fundamentally geographic. Why are there social and spatial inequalities in the world's cities and regions? What roles do geographies of social difference around race, class, ethnicity, and gender play in constructing and resisting power structures in society at large? Why does it make sense to view cultural practices like music or tourism as contested traditions in which geographic difference matters? What new relationships are forming around climate change and human and ecological health? Why is it important to understand struggles over the meaning of common lands and other natural resources? Why does climate change vary from place to place? What are the local vulnerabilities to flood hazards or the local prospects for renewable wind energy? \n\nGeography is a way of seeing which has unparalleled applicability in the world today. It is a meeting place for the study of social, political, cultural, and environmental changes, as these occur in cities, regions, countries, and globally. Students majoring in Geography or adding it as a double major can build an area of expertise matching their interests and imparting knowledge and skills to move them forward in their desired professional trajectory. With the assistance of our Undergraduate Advisor students choose courses to develop a theme in the major: in Urban Geography students focus on the social-spatial processes and patterns that result from human beings living in cities, including cities themselves as expressions of collective human life. In Environment, Health and Society, attention is drawn to the intersection between the human and natural world and the way those intersections impact human life, human health, and the natural world. In Economy and Development Studies the emphasis falls on the economic relationships and power differentials among different parts of the world.  Environmental Geography specializes in the scientific study of natural processes and systems from the perspective of the physical and biological sciences. In Geographic Information Science (GIS), students learn how to use different spatial software packages to use quantitative and qualitative data to analyze and visualize issues of geographic importance.\n\nThe Geography B.A. incorporates all of CLA's career competencies and prepares students for numerous career paths. Geographers have found a place in the for profit and non-profit sectors, in land use and natural resource planning agencies and departments at all levels of government, and more. Many Geography majors have become teachers or been accepted to graduate programs.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"34","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"51","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Geog","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10964"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10964"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10964","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"45.0701","id":"034820217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706129229860,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Geography B A","name":"Geography B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"034820217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"034820217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

For example, they learn how to evaluate a site on which a tunnel, dam, or road might be built. Geoengineers are involved with (a) geotechnical site investigation and characterization; (b) rock and soil slope stability analysis; (c) groundwater studies and engineering, natural and manmade hazard investigations, and (d) exploration and development of fossil fuel and mineral deposits. They interact with civil engineers to design foundations and retaining walls. Geoengineers prospect for minerals, building material resources, and drinking water. They carry out hazard and risk assessments and mapping for landslides, and they are responsible for environmental assessments or clean-up activities where pollution has occurred. They discover ways to protect the earth while still engineering systems needed for the well being of society. \n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,

History majors make sense of the world through the study of ancient times, the recent past, and everything in between. History majors are detectives, analysts, critical thinkers, and storytellers. Asking interesting questions about the past and examining a range of oral, written, visual, and material sources, history majors explore and explain how peoples across time and space have lived, loved, built community, warred, reconciled, and made sense of their worlds. Deep analysis invites new understandings of the past and the peoples, movements, ideas, technologies, and organisms propelling change. As much as history is a window into the past, it also helps us understand ourselves, our identities, and how we have come to inhabit the moral, ethical, social, economic, political, religious, national, environmental, ethnic, racial, gender, and sexual communities we live in today. History helps us understand how our present and possible futures grow out of a very usable and interesting past. \n\nHistory majors develop all of the skills required to thrive in today's world from an understanding of the engines of change and an ability to assess and interpret conflicting evidence and arguments, to robust oral and written communication skills that will allow you to shape the conversations in your professions and communities. History majors bring powerful skill sets into the world and many go into the legal and medical professions, become business people or scientists, are journalists and teachers, work in the civil or foreign service, run for office, or work in the arts or non-profit sector. Regardless of your career path, a history major will enable you to bring a fresh and critical historical perspective to the communities you live and work in. Historical thinking strengthens communities by encouraging them to think deeply about where they have come from and where they would like to go. This is an incredible time to declare a history major. \n\nMany history majors are double majors. A history major is well paired with the study of political science, economics, sociology, psychology, global studies, journalism, education, foreign languages, biology, math, and engineering. History is a very popular double major due to the broad range of courses offered by our faculty. Students are invited to study local, national, comparative, and global histories, which fascinate them and frequently provide the type of deep contextualization that complements other areas of study.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"34","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"43","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Hist","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10968"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10968"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10968","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"54.0101","id":"038020217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706129490522,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"History B A","name":"History B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"038020217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"038020217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

The program has links with the Departments of Classical & Near Eastern Studies, Sociology, History, Spanish & Portuguese Studies, French & Italian Studies, English, German, Nordic, Slavic & Dutch, Political Science, and the School of Music. The University's Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies also offers courses related to the Nazi Holocaust and its aftermath.\n\nJewish studies majors acquire marketable skills in critical analysis, research, and writing that are applicable across all disciplines and in a variety of professions. In addition, majors gain cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity that is sought after in the workplace, as well as a historical awareness of the complexities that define the modern world.

architecture is the design discipline concerned with the design, planning, and management of the land. Landscape architects use their knowledge of natural and infrastructural systems to create, plan, and preserve landscapes for human use, ecological function, and climate resilience. Landscape architects regularly work with other disciplines in this pursuit such as architects, civil engineers, urban planners, ecologists, and geoscientists, among others. The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture program prepares students for this field through courses focused on design and creativity, technology, socio/cultural and ecological systems, as well as theoretical and scientific knowledge bases. The eight semester curriculum will further prepare students for the professional practice of landscape architecture, which includes site design/development, urban design/planning, regional planning, and the design of climate resilient and sustainable landscapes across a broad range of types and scales.

Web: www.abfse.org.\n\nNational Board Examination pass rates, graduation rates, and employment rates for this and other ABFSE-accredited programs are available at www.abfse.org in the Directory of Accredited Programs.\n\nOUR MISSION:\nFuneral directors are health care professionals who serve others during a time of loss, pain, and grief. The Program of Mortuary Science's mission is to skillfully combine the study of behavioral, physical, and applied sciences for the goal of preparing graduates for careers as knowledgeable, skilled, and innovative funeral service professionals. Program graduates will be prepared to serve bereaved members of their communities in a manner that is proficient, dignified, and caring.\n\nPROGRAM LEARNING OUTCOMES:\nThe central objective of an ABFSE-accredited program must be to educate students in every phase of funeral service so that program graduates are prepared for entry-level employment in funeral service.\n\nUpon completion of an accredited program, students will be able to: \n-Explain the importance of funeral service professionals in developing relationships with the families and communities they serve. \n-Identify standards of ethical conduct in funeral service practice.\n-Interpret how federal, state, and local laws apply to funeral service in order to ensure compliance.   \n-Apply principles of public health and safety in the handling and preparation of human remains.\n-Demonstrate technical skills in embalming and restorative art that are necessary for the preparation and handling of human remains.\n-Demonstrate skills required for conducting arrangement conferences, visitations, services, and ceremonies.\n-Describe the requirements and procedures for burial, cremation, and other accepted forms of final disposition of human remains.\n-Describe methods to address the grief-related needs of the bereaved.\n-Explain management skills associated with operating a funeral establishment.\n-Demonstrate verbal and written communication skills and research skills needed for funeral service practice.\n\nSTATE-SPECIFIC ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS FOR LICENSURE:\nEducational requirements for licensure vary across states. Before pursuing a funeral service education program, you are advised to contact the regulatory board(s) in the state(s) where you wish to become licensed for specific information about academic requirements for licensure.

Students gain a solid foundation in music and join a vibrant community of students with an astonishingly diverse range of interests. BA majors are assigned to a faculty advisor based on their interests in music and career goals. Together they develop an appropriate trajectory of course selections that support the student's aspirations in the study of music and career objectives.\n\nStudents who pursue the music BA choose to specialize in one of two sub-plans: academic emphasis or applied emphasis.\n \nApplied Emphasis (see sample plan)\nThe BA in music with applied emphasis is for students seeking a liberal arts degree that embraces both applied study on a primary instrument in lesson and ensemble courses with the flexibility of elective coursework and foundational studies in music theory, musicology, keyboarding. This degree affords students the opportunity to hone performance skills and gain an increased knowledge of applied pedagogy. This emphasis requires a School of Music entrance application and audition.\n\nAcademic Emphasis (see sample plan)\nThe BA in music with an academic emphasis is designed for students who want a liberal arts education with significant rigor in the academic study of music. Students will focus on music theory, music history, world music, and choose a program concentration in an academic music field. While emphasis does not require a School of Music entrance audition, students need to complete a brief Statement of Interest after meeting with a School of Music during the major declaration process in order to be paired with a faculty advisor.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding\n","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"34","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"50","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Music","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10980"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10980"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10980","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"50.0901","id":"058020217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706129867673,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Music B A","name":"Music B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"058020217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"058020217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

The performance major is a professional degree program for musicians wishing to pursue in-depth study and practice in one of six sub-plans: classical guitar; harp; organ; piano; strings; woodwind, brass, percussion; and voice. \n\nStudents study one-on-one with studio faculty on a weekly basis developing both solo and group performance expertise on their individual instruments, which is further provided in chamber coaching and group ensemble work. Performance majors supplement their applied music study with courses that develop their comprehensive musicianship through theory and ear training, musicology, conducting, and upper-division writing.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding.\n\n","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"78","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"99","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"125","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Music","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10980"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10980"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10980","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"247 - Bachelor of Music","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Music","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"50.0901","id":"058024717-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706129949358,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Music B Mus","name":"Music B.

Students in this major will pursue coursework in instrumental techniques, methods and conducting, applied instrumental courses, and will participate in band or orchestra and a jazz or similar ensemble. \n\nChoral  view sample plan for Piano or Vocal Emphasis\nThis sub-plan is for students who want to teach choral and classroom music at the elementary and secondary level. Completion of this degree program meets licensure requirements for teaching choral and general classroom music for K12 in the state of Minnesota. Piano emphasis students will take courses in applied piano, general music, basic and choral conducting, pedagogy, style and diction, and voice. Vocal emphasis students will pursue coursework in voice, general music, basic and choral conducting, pedagogy, style and diction, and piano. Music education majors will also participate in a choral ensemble. \n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding.\n","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"97","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"111","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"126","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"129","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Music Educ","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10980"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10980"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10980","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"247 - Bachelor of Music","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Music","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"13.1312","id":"058424717-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706129991848,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Music Education B Mus","name":"Music Education B.

This program prepares students for a profession in music therapy, using music to influence behavioral changes in people, from pre-school through geriatrics, in a variety of educational and health-related environments.  Completion of the BMus in music therapy ensures eligibility to take the board certification exam. Successful completion of the exam legitmates students for practice as music therapist-board certified (MT-BC credential). Professional curriculum is approved by the American Music Therapy Association.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"92","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"107","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Music Ther","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10980"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10980"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10980","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"247 - Bachelor of Music","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Music","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"51.2305","id":"058624717-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706130048596,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049754,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Music Therapy B Mus","name":"Music Therapy B.

Philosophy poses questions about human endeavors and examines our basic assumptions about everything we think we know. It takes on challenging issues that sometimes defy resolution and trains the brain to think in a rigorous and analytic way about all the possible answers and what's at stake. Philosophy is not just a subject matter but a way of thinking. \n\nIn your philosophy courses, you will learn about the way that people throughout history have engaged in this kind of thinking with questions such as \"Can I really trust my senses to tell me about reality?\", \"Is anything really morally right or wrong or is it all just relative?\", \"Do scientific theories tell us the truth about the world or are they tools that are useful for certain purposes?\" and \"Are some societies more just than others?\". You will discover that thinking about these questions with an open mind is deeply satisfying. Philosophical thinking also contributes to a worthwhile life; in the words of Socrates \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". \n\nOf course, life isn't all about having fun thinking. Philosophy is also much more practical than you might think! Because philosophy is so far-reaching, the method it uses for study enhances the study of other fields such as art, math, science, language, and law with tremendous success. It is a great complement to other majors as a second major or a minor. You can find details about good combinations on our website. Also, studying philosophy is a fantastic way to hone your critical thinking and analytic writing skills. You'll learn two types of critical thinking: First, a method for rigorous analysis of arguments. Second, a habit of asking penetrating questions about the hidden assumptions of any position, ideology, or practice. You will develop your capacities to conceive of alternative assumptions, evaluate which ones are best and determine where they lead. You'll learn to write papers that clearly demonstrate these skills. \n\nAnd finally, you can reassure your parents about your choice of philosophy with the fact that the skills of critical thinking and analytic writing are highly desirable and sought by graduate programs and employers. Evidence of this includes: \n PHIL majors rank first among all majors in law school acceptance rate: 82.4%. \n PHIL majors rank first among all majors in verbal and analytic sections of the GRE (and first among humanities majors in the quantitative section) \n PHIL majors score higher on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (the test that most MBA programs require) than students in any business major (management, finance, accounting, marketing, etc.)\n PHIL majors' salaries increase more over 10 years than most other majors, including marketing and accounting (The Wall Street Journal). \n \"The present value of the extra earnings that graduates in humanities majors can expect over their lifetime is $444,700 for English majors, $537,800 for history majors, and $658,900 for philosophy majors\" (Forbes).\n\nFor more information, visit: http://www.philosophy.umn.edu/","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"33","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Phil","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10982"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10982"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10982","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"38.0101","id":"065220217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706130134835,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Philosophy B A","name":"Philosophy B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"065220217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"065220217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

The program is based upon principles from chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biological sciences.\n\nThis major is particularly appropriate for students who intend to enter medical school or graduate study in any of a variety of biological, health, or biomedical sciences. The required courses form a strong core in biomedical science. Many of the required courses are identical to those required for admission to medical school. Students may tailor the overall degree program to specific needs and may choose additional science courses in preparation for medical school, other health sciences professional schools, or graduate school. Students may also take advantage of the freedom to pursue a more diverse undergraduate experience in CLA. Others may benefit from an opportunity to pursue a double major. \n\nFor the latest information, visit the human physiology major website: https://med.umn.edu/physiology/education-training/undergraduate-program","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Math, Engineering, and Science","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"55","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"74","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Hum Phsl","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["11720"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","TMED - Medical School"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10925"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10925","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"26.0901","id":"068820217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706130222870,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Human Physiology B A","name":"Human Physiology B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"068820217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"068820217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All CLA BA degrees require 18 upper division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Political scientists study voters, politicians, interest groups, political parties, social movements, institutions, states, and public policies at all levels, from local communities to the global community. The discipline covers four thematic areas: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Political scientists employ multiple tools to learn about politics, including historical methods, case studies, and statistical, archival, and critical analyses. Political science majors develop an array of skills acquired through coursework, research opportunities with individual faculty, and internships that open multiple career opportunities in public, private, and non-profit sectors.\n\nStudents of American Politics seek to understand the way that collective governance happens in the United States. The American Politics subfield is divided into two areas: Political Behavior is the study of public opinion and electoral behavior of voting age adults, and Political Institutions is the study of the formal and informal structures of governance in the United States. Students will learn how research projects are designed and, in some courses, how to collect, examine, and present data. \n\nIn Comparative Politics, we seek to identify factors that explain political outcomes across time and space, with an eye to patterns that transcend historical and geographic particularities. Although Comparative Politics is sometimes thought to refer to the study of politics outside the United States, comparativists reject the idea that American politics are not amenable to comparative analysis. Comparative Politics courses will make you a more informed and discerning citizen in our interconnected world.\n \nIn International Relations, we study how the countries of the world do and don't get along. We address fundamental questions of war and peace, conflict and cooperation, trade, migration, and finance. Taking courses in International Relations helps students better understand how the world works. Students will be expected to write policy memos, conduct independent research, take part in simulations and debates, and devise policy solutions to complicated challenges.\n\nPolitical Theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental political concepts. Starting from foundational concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power and justice, theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. Students who study Political Theory become more adept at critical thinking, careful reading and clear writing, and recognizing and constructing arguments. These skills are basic for the critical, lifelong role that all of us play as members of political community.\n\nTaking classes across the subfields enables students to become more informed citizens and to pursue a wide variety of careers. Political science majors learn skills including oral and written communication, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and digital competencies.","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":false,"cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"36","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"36","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramGPAGoodStanding":"2.8","cdProgramDualDeg":true,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDegTitle":"MURP/JD: 29 credits in common allowed.

millennia, our survival as human beings has depended on our ability to understand and predict others' behaviors. Today, personal and professional success continues to depend on understanding and predicting human experiences and behavior. Psychology is the scientific study of these experiences and behaviors. Given humans' imposing complexity, psychologists employ a range of perspectives, including evolutionary, biological, social, organizational, institutional, and sociocultural. In turn, these perspectives influence psychologists' levels of explanation, from genetics to brain physiology, personality, individual differences, social interactions and group memberships, the institutions that we inhabit, and the cultures in which we spend our lives. Like all liberal arts disciplines, psychology addresses human experience, but what makes psychology unique as a scientific discipline are the concepts that psychologists use to make sense of people and the methods that they use to learn more about them.\n\nOur baccalaureate programs provide students with a strong general background in all areas of psychology and with\nthe ability to think and reason critically in a wide variety of settings. All psychology students complete three critical courses essential to achieve those goals: PSY 1001 (Introduction to Psychology) provides a broad overview of what psychologists know about human behavior; PSY 3001W (Introduction to Research Methods) focuses on the skills necessary to generate new knowledge; and PSY 3801 (Introduction to Psychological Measurement and Data Analysis) addresses the skills necessary to test hypotheses using statistical methods. Students will complete additional courses focused on their individual interests, and even if they never plan to become psychological scientists, students will develop the skills needed throughout their lives to be sophisticated evaluators of psychological information and to navigate the complexities of human behavior.\n\nThe B.S. degree emphasizes outside coursework closely related to biological and quantitative psychology, including fields such as neuroscience, cognitive and computer science, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. The B.S. prepares students for graduate work in psychology and related fields, and we encourage students interested in the biological, genetic, or evolutionary underpinnings of human behavior to complete outside courses in the life sciences, including biology, chemistry, and evolution. We encourage students interested in quantitative approaches and the cognitive underpinnings of human behavior to complete outside courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. A B.S. degree in psychology provides a valuable background for a variety of careers and graduate and professional academic programs, including psychology, medicine, neuroscience, and computer science. A professional career as a psychologist requires training beyond the baccalaureate degree.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"54","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"61","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Psy","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10986"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10986"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10986","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1103","hegisCode":"42.0101","id":"081220117-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706130275982,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Psychology B S","name":"Psychology B.S.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"081220117","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"081220117","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"At least 16 upper-division credits in the major must be taken at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus. \n<br>\n<br>Students may earn no more than one undergraduate degree in psychology: a BA or a BS or a minor.

Today, personal and professional success continues to depend on understanding and predicting human experiences and behavior. Psychology is the scientific study of these experiences and behaviors. Given humans' imposing complexity, psychologists employ a range of perspectives, including evolutionary, biological, social, organizational, institutional, and sociocultural. In turn, these perspectives influence psychologists' levels of explanation, from genetics to brain physiology, personality, individual differences, social interactions and group memberships, the institutions that we inhabit, and the cultures in which we spend our lives. Like all liberal arts disciplines, psychology addresses human experience, but what makes psychology unique as a scientific discipline are the concepts that psychologists use to make sense of people and the methods that they use to learn more about them.\n\nOur baccalaureate programs provide students with a strong general background in all areas of psychology and with the ability to think and reason critically in a wide variety of settings. All psychology students complete three critical courses essential to achieve those goals: PSY 1001 (Introduction to Psychology) provides a broad overview of what psychologists know about human behavior; PSY 3001W (Introduction to Research Methods) focuses on the skills necessary to generate new knowledge; and PSY 3801 (Introduction to Psychological Measurement and Data Analysis) addresses the skills necessary to test hypotheses using statistical methods. Students will complete additional courses focused on their individual interests, and even if they never plan to become psychological scientists, students will develop the skills needed throughout their lives to be sophisticated evaluators of psychological information and to navigate the complexities of human behavior.\n\nThe B.A. degree emphasizes outside coursework in the social sciences, arts, and humanities, including sociology, economics, political science, anthropology, history, philosophy, and literature, given the perspectives and levels of explanation that inform these disciplines. Like psychology, these disciplines focus on the thoughts, feelings, and motivations that make us human, including those that arise from our personalities, relationships, and the larger social forces that shape our experiences. For example, art historians may look to visual portrayals of women over time to understand their lives; sociologists may focus on religion, crime, and race and ethnicity, all phenomena of interest to psychologists; political scientists may focus on citizens' political attitudes and activities; and business-related specialties like personnel selection, marketing, and leadership often rest on psychological principles. A B.A. degree in psychology provides valuable preparation for a variety of careers and graduate and professional academic programs, including psychology, law, management, human resources, and education. A professional career as a psychologist requires training beyond the baccalaureate degree.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"36","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"36","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Psy","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10986"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10986"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10986","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"42.0101","id":"081220217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706130305815,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Psychology B A","name":"Psychology B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"081220217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"081220217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Public health is the field of study that identifies and monitors these threats, while at the same time, developing and evaluating interventions that reduce their negative impact on community health. Multiple forms of knowledge  coming from analytical, creative, biological, psychological and socio-cultural bases  are needed to effectively work in public health. This bachelor of arts degree focuses on increasing student knowledge of multiple fields that create effective public health strategies to prevent disease, promote health in communities, and eliminate inequalities.   \n\nThe University of Minnesota School of Public Health Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Public Health is a robust undergraduate public health degree to develop graduates who can apply a public health approach to address a broad range of societal challenges. A public health approach is grounded in social justice, and emphasizes addressing challenges at the systems level with a focus on prevention and population health. Graduates will have an academic and experiential background that prepares them to understand, critically evaluate, and impact current and emerging challenges to the health of our global society.\n\nSpecifically, graduates from this program will be able to describe the foundational principles of public health, be able to understand basic methods for gathering and analyzing public health data (through surveillance and research), demonstrate understanding of how public health and social justice share common goals, and be able to communicate in both community and professional settings. This junior-admitting program prepares graduates for entry-level positions in the public health workforce with employment at local health departments, not-for-profit agencies, healthcare systems or standalone research entities. Students interested in pursuing clinical degrees in other health-related fields would also benefit from this program. In addition, students interested in pursuing a terminal degree (a Master's of Public Health or doctoral degree) in public health should consider this degree program as an introduction to the knowledge paradigms used in the field; graduate-level training would build upon this program by providing greater skill development, depth of understanding, and advanced methodologies.\n","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":true,"cdProgramAccreditedName":"Council

The subject of religion is by its very nature interdisciplinary, attracting interest from many perspectives, including textual and literary studies, history, sociology, anthropology, the arts, and philosophy. \n\nStudents in the religious studies program select one of two tracks. The \"religion, culture, and society\" track is designed for students who seek to study religious traditions broadly or comparatively. The \"texts and traditions\" track is for students who seek to study a single tradition deeply, reading its foundational texts in their original language. Both tracks examine religion as a social and cultural force affecting fundamental issues of our world. All majors take courses in at least two religious traditions and develop an interdisciplinary concentration area consisting of four courses, selected from a variety of departments and focused on a theme, tradition, time period, location, practice, or set of questions. The area of concentration must be approved by the major advisor. \n\nFor more information, visit the Religious Studies website at https://cla.umn.edu/religious-studies.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Communications, Languages, and Cultural Studies","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"31","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"50","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Relig Stdy","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10956"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10956"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10956","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"38.0201","id":"083420217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706130333342,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Religious Studies B A","name":"Religious Studies B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"083420217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"083420217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"Students in Track I do not have a language requirement that is specific to the major.

In particular, Russia has produced one of the world's most vibrant and exciting literary traditions, including the works of poets like Pushkin, Lermontov, Blok, and Akhmatova, and writers like Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov.

Faculty interests in the comparative study of social relations and institutions in various countries add an international emphasis to these areas of study. All sociology courses emphasize the skills of social inquiry necessary for analyzing patterns of social relationships. The sociology BS program is for students interested in developing a rigorous mathematical concentration in research methodologies. This option builds on course requirements for the sociology BA program by featuring 12-16 additional credits of upper division coursework in one of four clusters: (1) organizations, business, or non-profits, (2) health care and careers, (3) policy analysis, or (4) quantitative emphasis. \n\nStudents who graduate from our Sociology program enjoy a wide range of employment opportunities - business, non-profit, government, and non-governmental organizations. The concepts and skills students learn in our Sociology programs equip them to critically analyze the evolving world and the place within, and help them complete effectively in today and tomorrow's job market.\n\nFor more information, visit the sociology website at www.cla.umn.edu/sociology","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":true,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseMin":"1","cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"53","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"61","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"SOC-L/C/J","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10987"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10987","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}]},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1003","hegisCode":"45.0401","id":"086720117-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1692180053246,"lastEditedBy":"$integration","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Soc of Law/Crim/Justice BS","name":"SOC-L/C/J","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"086720117","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"086720117","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programAdmissionRequirements","label":"Admission Requirements","notes":"Students who are interested in the BS option are encouraged to schedule a meeting with the departmental advisor to discuss the major and its requirements.","editorEnabled":false},{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"Students are required to complete a sub-plan in consultation with the departmental advisor.

All major and minor options in this department begin with prerequisite language courses, followed by advanced language skills courses (special arrangements may be made for native speakers of Spanish or Portuguese). These are followed by critical analysis skills courses in Hispanic literature, culture, and linguistics that prepare students to take advanced coursework in specific areas. The major options culminate in the completion of a capstone project through a SPAN 5xxx course or SPAN 3972W.\n\nMajors are required to enroll in a minimum 6-week study abroad experience, or a semester-long service learning course. The study abroad requirement must be fulfilled in a Spanish-speaking country or territory, involve at least one three-credit course taught in Spanish, and include courses related to Spanish studies.

All major and minor options in this department begin with prerequisite language courses, followed by advanced language skills courses (special arrangements may be made for native speakers of Spanish or Portuguese). These are followed by critical analysis skills courses in Hispanic/Lusophone literature, culture, and linguistics that prepare students to take advanced coursework in specific areas. The major options culminate in the completion of a capstone through a SPPT 5xxx course, a PORT 5xxx course, or SPAN 3972W. \n\nThe department strongly encourages majors and minors to study abroad in a Spanish or Portuguese speaking country or territory.

Major coursework provides a background in human communication including the physical, biological, and socio-behavioral processes that empower or disrupt the production and understanding of speech and language. These complex processes are ones that are often taken for granted, but a disorder of one of these processes caused by disease, a problem at birth, or aging can have a profound effect on a person's life. The field of speech-language-hearing sciences defines normal and disordered communication and provides the research foundation for diagnosis and treatment of communication disorders. \n\nThe SLHS curriculum blends science, language and communication, and aims to provide exceptional academic preparation and opportunities for students who are interested in physical and biological sciences and enjoy learning about linguistic, psychological, and neurophysiological theories and methods for diagnosing and treating voice, speech, language and hearing disorders. This foundational knowledge helps students reach careers such as speech-language pathologist, audiologist, psychologist, therapist, counselor, vocal coach, researcher, instructor, manager, or director in related fields.  \n\nProgram requirements for the SLHS major fulfill a number of the University's Liberal Education (LE) requirements. Major students also have multiple options to meet the LE requirement by taking courses in related fields, such as psychology, education, humanities, and social sciences.\n","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"36","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"37","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Spch/Hear","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10989"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10989"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10989","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"51.0204","id":"088620217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706132392446,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Spch-Lang-Hearing Sciences B A","name":"Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"088620217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"088620217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

The TWC major offers students who enjoy writing the opportunity to use written, digital, oral, and visual communication theory and practice as it happens in the current workplace. Students will study writing and editing, rhetorical theory, visual rhetoric and document design, usability, and technical communication practices.\n\nTWC majors examine how communication is a complex process that involves both the robust principles of audience, persuasion, clarity, accuracy, and ethical integrity, and a command of the knowledge of scientific and technical topics that one communicates.  \n\nOrganizations, both for profit and non-profit, demand people who can communicate ideas or concepts clearly, ethically, and with authority. At the core of these communication skills is a knowledge of writing and how it creates understandings with particular audiences. TWC graduates work in many areas, including health, business, science, law, and technology. Technical writer, usability specialist, user experience designer, and content strategist are just a few of the titles our graduates hold.\n\n\nWhy major in TWC?\n\n1. TWC majors are in demand and sought after by employers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts technical communication as a career will grow  faster than average over the next decade. And US News and World Report lists technical writer in the top 100 jobs for 2020!\n2. Our advisory board of alumni and industry professionals offers networking, mentorship, internship, and job opportunities.\n3. Students learn to use rhetoric as a powerful communication tool.\n4. Students become familiar with current writing and web technologies.\n5. TWC pairs well with other majors such as political or health science. \n6. Sub-plans enable students to focus their writing skills in one of four emphasis areas: information technology and design, biological and health sciences, legal discourse and public policy, or environmental science.\n\nFor more information, visit z.umn.edu/writugrad.\n","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":false,"cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"55","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"TecWritCom","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10994"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10994","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}]},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1149","hegisCode":"09.9999","id":"091320117-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1692180053246,"lastEditedBy":"$integration","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Technical Writing & Comm B S","name":"TecWritCom","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"091320117","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"091320117","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"At least 22 upper division credits in the major must be taken at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus.\n<br>\n<br>Students may earn a BS, a minor, or a certificate in technical writing and communication, but none of these may be combined.\n<br>\n<br>All incoming CLA first-year (freshmen) must complete the First-Year Experience course sequence. \n<br>\n<br>All incoming CLA first-year (freshmen) students earning a BA, BS, or BIS degree must complete the second-year career management course CLA 3002.\n<br>\n<br>All students must complete a capstone in at least one CLA major.

Students benefit from access to an eclectic range of local theatres, and from our unique emphasis on devised, ensemble-created theatre, and physical approaches to performance.

University established the urban studies program in 1969. In the 1960s, studying cities and urban life and form was considered avant-garde in all disciplines. Urban studies is an explicitly cross-disciplinary major rooted in College of Liberal Arts but accepting courses from a diversity of undergraduate colleges. The program offers students a mix of academic, hands-on, experiential and skill-based coursework focused on a common theme of urban social/cultural issues, urban political economy and planning, urban infrastructure and environment, or international urban issues. Through required urban studies coursework students are exposed to local practitioners who teach courses based around their areas of expertise such as: homeless youth, public-private partnerships, transit development, or housing in an international perspective. These local practitioners expose students to the diverse careers that can come from a degree on urban studies. Students are encouraged to study abroad.\n\nStudents who major in urban studies come to understand the way cities work and use the vast resources of the Twin Cities to explore their interests. All students complete one required 140 hour internship as part of their exploration of careers they might pursue. Finding an internship is great practice for a job hunt. With the vast local network of alumnus of the program, there are many internship possibilities each term.  \n \nThe program offers one-on-one advising and students come to know one another through shared classes and through the student group: Minnesota Urban Studies Student Association\n \nPost graduation some students go on to graduate school in fields as diverse as social work, law, finance, geography, and medicine.

In the 1960s, studying cities and urban life and form was considered avant-garde in all disciplines. Urban studies is an explicitly cross-disciplinary major rooted in College of Liberal Arts but accepting courses from a diversity of undergraduate colleges. The program offers students a mix of academic, hands-on, experiential, and skill-based coursework focused on a common theme of urban social/cultural issues, urban political economy and planning, urban infrastructure and environment, or international urban issues. Through required urban studies coursework students are exposed to local practitioners who teach courses based around their areas of expertise such as homeless youth, public-private partnerships, transit development, or housing in an international perspective. These local practitioners expose students to the diverse careers that can come from a degree on urban studies. Students are encouraged to study abroad.\n\nStudents who major in urban studies come to understand the way cities work and use the vast resources of the Twin Cities to explore their interests. All students complete one required 140 hour internship as part of their exploration of careers they might pursue. Finding an internship is great practice for a job hunt. With the vast local network of alumnus of the program, there are many internship possibilities each term.  \n \nThe program offers one-on-one advising and students come to know one another through shared classes and through the student group: Minnesota Urban Studies Student Association.\n \nPost graduation some students go on to graduate school in fields as diverse as social work, law, finance, geography, and medicine. Other students elect to spend their post-graduate year in a service based organization such as Teach for America, Peace Corps, Reading Corps, Americorps etc. The majority go on to get some on-the-job experience.\n \nUrban studies gives students a breadth of knowledge and the knowledge of how to be engaged in urban issues often leading  to long-term careers in public service.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"36","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"44","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Urban Stdy","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10964"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10964"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10964","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0003","hegisCode":"45.1201","id":"093020217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706132443710,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Urban Studies B A","name":"Urban Studies B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"093020217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"093020217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Program coursework will challenge students to examine sport from a variety of perspectives including social, psychological, legal, and economic. Graduates are prepared to think innovatively about the manner by which sport impacts, and is impacted by, broader cultural, economic, technological, and societal shifts. \n\nGraduates may find employment in sport marketing and management, parks and recreation, agency and advertising, sales and fundraising, community sport, coaching, community outreach and engagement, event and facilities management, and other sport, physical activity, or fitness-related occupations. The program also prepares students for graduate study in sport management and broader fields.\n\nCoursework in sport management addresses topics such as legal issues and risk management, career exploration, ethics and sport, sport as a sociocultural phenomenon, corporate social responsibility in sport, organizational behavior, organizational theory, sport business, sport marketing, sport entrepreneurship, and facility and event management. A hallmark of the program is its strong connection with the Minnesota sports community. As a result, students have wide ranging opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the sport industry throughout their time in the program.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramCurrContactName":"Michael Klecker","cdProgramCurrContactEmail":"mklecker@umn.edu","cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Education","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"79","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"80","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Sport Mgmt","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["11222"],"cdProgramProposalSummary":"Update to add newly created PE courses as optional electives, 9/7/23 MSK","cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCED - College of Education and Human Development"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["11222"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"11222","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCED - College of Education and Human Development","UoHKm":false,"NK1s2":false,"g9JMc":false,"o8EfQ":false,"a3nTH":false,"reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate","X1TcH":true},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Program's Admit Term","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCED","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCED"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2024-01-16","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"0053","hegisCode":"31.0504","id":"104520106-2024-01-16","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706132683116,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"06UGR Col of Educ/Human Development","longName":"","name":"Sport Management B.S.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"104520106","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"104520106","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programAdmissionRequirements","label":"Admission Requirements","notes":"<p>Successful applicants will have:</p><ul><li><p>45 credits completed or in progress </p></li><li><p>Earned a 2.00 GPA, or higher</p></li><li><p>The required prerequisite coursework completed or in progress</p></li></ul><p>Admission preference is given to students who have: </p><ul><li><p>45 credits completed,</p></li><li><p>Earned a 2.75 GPA, or higher</p></li><li><p>Completed the required prerequisite courses. </p></li></ul><p>All incoming CEHD Freshman must complete the First-Year Inquiry course EDHD 1525W. <br> For information about University of Minnesota admission requirements, visit the Office of Admissions website. <br></p>","editorEnabled":false},{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"At least 18 upper-division credits in the major must be taken at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus.","editorEnabled":false},{"key":"programSubPlanRequirements","label":"Program Sub-Plan Requirements","editorEnabled":false}],"requisites":{"requisitesSimple":[{"id":"104520106","name":"Program Requirements","type":"Completion Requirements","requirementLevel":"programRequirements","showInCatalog":true,"rules":[{"id":"419743","name":"Foundation Courses","description":"Students must take 14 credits within the foundation course requirements;

For example, you will learn to think of climate change not only in terms of CO2 levels in the atmosphere, but also in terms of politics, ecologies, social movements, and global inequalities. When you examine migration, you will study not only laws and non-governmental organizations analyses of mobility trends, but the geopolitical upheavals and food systems failures that drive these trends. And students will always keep in view the grassroots and community initiatives that address these problems on the ground, since that is where the impacts of these issues are most powerfully felt and creative solutions worked out. In short, Global Studies is a major for students who are committed both to understanding the world they live in, and to making that world a better place. \n\nGlobal Studies courses traverse geography and time. Some analyze the workings of global institutions and explore the operations of the global health, food, and financial systems. Others use works of art and philosophy from around the world to expose students to cultural forms like indigenous art and prison literature. Still others explore long term historical trajectories, such as the growth of global communications, media, and tourism industries. You will also have the opportunity to study abroad, intern, and engage deeply with on and off campus communities. In capstone projects you will bring together what you've studied to define, explore, and create new visions of the world. You will learn both critical thinking and practice the empathy needed to construct global citizenship for the 21st century.\n\nAll learning experiences offer ample opportunities for developing the communications and organizational skills that support success in future careers in any number of sectors including nonprofits, government, and industry, as well as for graduate study in a number of arenas in law, policy, social sciences, and the humanities.","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":false,"cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"36","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Global Stu","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10971"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10971","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}]},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1003","hegisCode":"45.0901","id":"136820217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1692180053246,"lastEditedBy":"$integration","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Global Studies B A","name":"Global Stu","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"136820217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"136820217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

in cinema and media culture (SCMC) examines cinema and media by emphasizing its location within the intricate social, historical, and cultural matrix of audiovisual forms and practices. Core courses and electives are offered not only in the Department of Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature (CSCL), but also in a number of other contributing departments. Through the program's interdisciplinary framework, students explore the sounds and images of cinema and media as they have changed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Print, photography, radio, television, video, and digital media are also considered crucial to understanding our media cultures. Students develop the ability to \"read\" the production and circulation of meaning in cinema and media, especially within the institutions of mass culture; examine the history of cinema and media cultures; engage the cross-cultural and global dynamics of production and reception; and explore the theoretical models that have shaped thinking about the cinema and media.\n\nAlthough the major includes a production component, its principal focus is on cultural contexts, history, and theory.\n\nFor the latest information on the SCMC major, visit the CSCL website\n","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Communications, Languages, and Cultural Studies","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"33","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"40","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Cinema,Med","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10959"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10959"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10959","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1019","hegisCode":"50.0699","id":"202720217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706132769103,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049755,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Studies:Cinema,Media Cultur BA","name":"Studies in Cinema and Media Culture B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"202720217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"202720217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Drawing upon the curricular offerings of most of the University's colleges and departments, students design either a bachelor of arts (BA) or a bachelor of science (BS) degree incorporating a significant amount of coursework from at least two different colleges within the University system.\n\nBachelor of science degrees are those that pertain to the physical or biological sciences, have significant quantitative or investigative tools/methods expectations, or have a pronounced applied/professional component (e.g., public health, education, business, social work). Most students design a degree drawing from two or three departmental areas from the University. Examples include sustainability studies, communication studies, and HECUA; or Carlson School of Management, manufacturing operations management, and applied economics.  \n\nICP is most appropriate for self-directed students whose educational backgrounds and career and intellectual interests require both a clear personal focus and a flexible interdisciplinary approach.  Interested students should attend one of the weekly information sessions, in which academic advisers provide a detailed introduction to the program and help students begin the planning process.

cross-college, course/credit-based degree options. Drawing upon the curricular offerings of most of the University's colleges and departments, students design either a bachelor of arts (BA) or a bachelor of science (BS) degree incorporating a significant amount of coursework from at least two different colleges within the University system. \n\nBachelor of arts degrees include significant coursework in the liberal arts, such as that found in arts and humanities and the social sciences. BA degrees also require completion of second language studies. Most students design a degree drawing from two or three departmental areas from the University. Examples include sustainability studies, communication studies, and HECUA; or Carlson School of Management, manufacturing operations management, and applied economics. \n\nICP is most appropriate for self-directed students whose educational backgrounds and career and intellectual interests require both a clear personal focus and a flexible interdisciplinary approach. Interested students should attend one of the weekly information sessions, in which academic advisors provide a detailed introduction to the program and help students begin the planning process.

The BSE major is built on the idea that problems of biology, health, and the environment emerge at the intersection of natural and human systems. To understand these problems and their solutions, and to build skill sets to address them, requires that students have experience in the biological and natural sciences as well as in the social sciences and humanities.\n\nThe BSE degree provides a flexible curriculum that allows students to focus the degree to fit their personal, intellectual and professional goals. The BSE degree can prepare students for a wide variety of careers including laboratory science, environmental testing, health and environmental policy, public health, science education, and science communication, as well as a variety of academic and professional graduate programs.\n\nThe BSE major is an excellent choice for students interested in pursuing work in the health professions. Students can design their BSE major to provide the foundational science coursework necessary for their choice of M.D., D.D.S., Pharm.D., R.N., O.T., P.T. and PA programs. Medical programs are increasingly looking for students who have an education that includes social sciences and the humanities. BSE includes courses that help students understand the relationship of a diverse society to our medical system and provides students with the opportunity to think about health not just as an attribute of the biology of the body, but also as a complicated outcome of how different bodies relate to economic, cultural, and social systems.\n\nCourse work in BSE offers students the opportunity to study scientific practices and social and environmental problems. Just as importantly, students have the opportunity to:\n Develop critical thinking skills and creative approaches to understanding such practices and problems using an array of conceptual and theoretical frameworks,\n Consider the ethical issues inherent to both practices and problems and, of course, solutions,\n Enhance their ability to communicate, particularly through writing,\n Work as a team member to bridge disciplinary and institutional divisions,\n Develop language skills to help them better engage with their own diverse communities or to open up opportunities for international work.\n\nResearch is a regular part of the BSE curriculum, and students are encouraged to work with the BSE adviser to find opportunities to work directly with faculty on their research or to find a faculty member to supervise a research project developed by the student. Independent research can provide students with excellent experience that helps them pursue their career goals.\n\nNavigating the Catalog:\nThere are a huge number of courses that count for the BSE major. It can be tricky to understand what is available. To see what is available semester by semester, students should look at the BSE course guide published each semester by the BSE advising office.

Students develop verbal and visual skills in architecture, and practice the design process as a dialogue between divergent and convergent making and thinking. They undertake projects that link architecture with explorations in visual media (including film, photography, virtual reality), social, cultural and environmental concerns (preservation, disaster relief, neighborhood needs), focused concerns (daylight, facade, material, or modeling studies), and allied disciplines (set design, landscape architecture, urban studies).\n\nAll major coursework must be taken A-F.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Art, Design, and the Performing Arts","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"72","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Architectu","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10827"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TALA - College of Design"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10827"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10827","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TALA - College of Design","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Program's Admit Term","degreeDesignation":"231 - Bachelor of Design in Architecture","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TALA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TALA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Design in Architecture","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1069","hegisCode":"04.0201","id":"214623122-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706133337006,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049756,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"22UGR College of Design","longName":"Bachelor of Design in Architec","name":"Architecture B.D.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"214623122","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"214623122","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"The Architecture BDA requires 9 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside College of Design designators.

B.ISyE/MS.ISyE","notes":"Students can prepare for a rewarding career in the area of Analytics by earning both a Bachelor's in ISyE and a Master of Science in ISyE (Analytics track) in just five years through ISyEs integrated B.ISyE/M.S. in ISyE program. Students in the integrated program can save both time and money without sacrificing any aspect of the undergraduate or graduate experience.\n<br>\n<br>Benefits of the Integrated Program\n<br>The integrated program offers streamlined early admission to the MS program and the possibility of early completion of the MS degree.\n<br>\n<br>ISyE undergraduate students are eligible to apply to the integrated program as early as spring of their junior year and receive an admission decision by that summer. Admitted students can start earning course credit toward their graduate degree during their senior year. Students who begin their freshman year with credit for three or more Bachelors courses can often complete both the Bachelors and Masters degrees within five years (10 semesters).\n<br>\n<br>Completion of the Analytics track M.S. degree allows students to broaden and deepen their knowledge of analytics (optimization, operations research, data analysis, computation, and statistics) considerably beyond what is covered in the undergraduate curriculum. The Analytics track of the M.S. program includes rigorous coursework as well as an industry-sponsored capstone project. Further information about the Analytics track is available at https://cse.umn.edu/isye/ms-analytics.<br><br>Integrated Program Curriculum\n<br>\n<br>Students are required to have at least 122 course credits for the Bachelor's degree, and at least 30 additional credits for the Analytics track M.S. degree. Among the 30 M.S. credits, 24 are required course credits and 6 are approved elective credits. Credits cannot be shared between the two degrees; double counting of courses is not allowed.\n<br>\n<br>The sample program below provides just one example of how a student who entered the university as a freshman with three liberal education courses completed can earn the B.ISyE and M.S. in ISyE degrees in five years (10 semesters). Such a student could complete most technical elective courses during the junior year, and begin completing M.S. courses during the senior year. With this plan, the student would graduate with the B.ISyE degree at the end of the 4th year of study, and would graduate with the M.S. degree at the end of the 5th year of study. \n<br>\n<br>Students who entered the university without any credits are also eligible to apply to the integrated program, but they may need an additional semester to complete the Masters degree.\n<br>\n<br>Sample Fourth- and Fifth-year Course Sequence\n<br>\n<br>This plan is not a contract and is subject to variation.

As a land grant institution, the University has a mission to contribute to the state's communities, and the major will help fulfill that mission. The department also prioritizes local American Indian community engagement and advocacy. One of the single best ways to create positive change within our communities is to instill pride and celebrate cultural traditions like language at an early age. \n\nWhat distinguishes this program from any other is our use of both academically rigorous grammatical instruction (supported by linguistic research) coupled with the use of immersion techniques inside the classroom. This method has proven to be a very powerful combination in helping our students reach a high level of proficiency in the Ojibwe language. Students who complete the program to attain this high proficiency will have the foundational skills to contribute to Ojibwe language community building by bringing the Ojibwe language back into the home, to go into the high-demand field of immersion teaching, and to work in language preservation programs. With this major, students will:\n\n1) Be more prepared to fill an ever-growing need for immersion teacher positions;\n2) Graduate with a more sophisticated knowledge of the Ojibwe language in general;\n3) Graduate with the prestige that comes of having earned a bachelor's degree in the Ojibwe language;\n4) Have more time to increase their fluency under instructor supervision;\n5) Increase their knowledge of immersion pedagogy;\n6) Earn a bachelor's degree in the Ojibwe language (rather than a certificate) thereby increasing both their Ojibwe language credentials and earning potential upon graduation.","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":false,"cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"34","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"45","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Ojibwe Lan","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10948"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10948","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}]},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1169","hegisCode":"16.1001","id":"220620217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1692180053246,"lastEditedBy":"$integration","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049756,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Ojibwe Language B A","name":"Ojibwe Lan","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"220620217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"220620217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"Students are required to complete 4 semester(s) of Ojibwe with a grade of C-, or better, or demonstrate proficiency in the language(s) as defined by the department or college.\n<br>\n<br>CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Many of our students also have majors in such fields as business, computer science, biology, English, history, linguistics, or political science, or have interdisciplinary concentrations like global, media, and sustainability studies. In the GSD major, students develop advanced language competency, come to understand changing cultural and social contexts in relation to various forms of media (from oral and manuscript traditions to book culture, film, and hypermedia), and deepen their interdisciplinary understanding of other cultures. A major in GSD is ideally suited for students wishing to work in public, private, and non-profit organization fields, especially in areas where multilingual and transcultural knowledge is essential. The department recommends study abroad in the target language for at least six months to strengthen cultural familiarity and language fluency. Students may apply appropriate study abroad coursework to the major or minors. Minors are available in Dutch, German, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Austrian & Central European Studies.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Communications, Languages, and Cultural Studies","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"33","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"54","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"GrmnAdv-L","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10967"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10967"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10967","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1133","hegisCode":"16.0599","id":"228220217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706133586791,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049756,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Ger, Scandinavian, Dutch B A","name":"German, Scandinavian, Dutch B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"228220217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"228220217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"Students are required to complete 4 semester(s) of Dutch, or Finnish, or German, or Norwegian, or Swedish. with a grade of C-, or better, or demonstrate proficiency in the language(s) as defined by the department or college.\n<br>\n<br>CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

The activities include farming, food processing and manufacturing, food distribution and retailing, food consumption, and managing post-consumption food waste. The food systems major offers graduates the knowledge, problem-solving skills, and leadership ability to address complex and often controversial challenges and opportunities in food systems, guided by a desire to create systems that are increasingly sustainable in environmental, economic, and social terms, in diverse contexts and at different scales.\n\nThe core courses in the food systems major begin with an orientation to food systems followed by a core sequence that provides a basic understanding of the structure and interactions within food systems; introduces techniques for life cycle analysis of the outcomes, impacts, and sustainability of food systems; and explores conventional, sustainable, and organic examples of production systems for food plants. The core course sequence culminates in a capstone experience aimed at solving real-world problems in local community food systems, and involvement in future systems design and visioning. \n\nStudents will choose from one of two existing tracks of required courses or in collaboration with an advisor, will develop an individually tailored coursework track.\n\nFlexibility in course sequence and required courses has been incorporated into the major so that students can transfer into the program and still graduate in a timely fashion. This flexibility will also make it attractive to students who wish to pursue a dual major or minor with food systems as one of those majors.","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliverySite":"none","cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAccreditedName":"na","cdProgramAccreditedAddress":"na","cdProgramAccreditedPhone":"na","cdProgramAccreditedWebsite":"na","cdProgramAccreditedRevFreq":"Other","cdProgramAccreditedRevFreqOther":"n/a","cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":false,"cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmitMin":"2.5","cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUTMin":"2.5","cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPARationale":"none","cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"71","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"SustAgFood","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCOA - College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["11030"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCOA - College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"11030","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"status":"Active","cdProgramCurrContactName":"Natalie Slinger","cdProgramCurrContactEmail":"sling017@umn.edu","cdProgramProposalSummary":"10/6/23 Adding collegiate feedback:\nNo concerns from CBS. -Laurie Parker \nCarlson doesn't have any concerns. -Vladas Griskevicius\nThe School of Public Health has no conflicts with your proposals. -Elizabeth V.

Strykowski\n\n9/29/23-  We are proposing a restructuring of the current undergraduate program sub-plans within the interdisciplinary and interdepartmental Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems B.S. major. This proposal combines two similar sub-plans (Agroecology and Organic and Local Food Production) into a new sub-plan titled Sustainable Food Production. This streamlines the sub-plan and reduces confusion with the pre-existing Agroecology sub-plan within the Plant Science major and expands course electives.\n\nIn addition, we have made modifications and updates to the Consumers and Markets sub-plan, now titled Food Marketing and Supply Chains, which removes nutrition related courses and takes advantage of new course offerings. These proposed changes better align sub-plans along disciplinary fields of study and should make it easier for students to choose specialized areas of study while simultaneously gaining general knowledge of sustainable agriculture and food system complexity within the integrated core. These changes have already been approved by CFANS. \n\nWe are also fixing issues that were generated with the migration to Coursedog and updating internship requirement courses to reflect a change in offerings. -NS","g9JMc":false,"a3nTH":true,"X1TcH":true,"UoHKm":false,"o8EfQ":false,"NK1s2":false},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Program's Admit Term","degreeDesignation":"201 - Bachelor of Science","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCOA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCOA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Science","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2024-01-16","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1139","hegisCode":"19.0599","id":"228920130-2024-01-16","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1705001374024,"lastEditedBy":"sling017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049756,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"30UGR Col of Food, Agr & Nat Res Sci","longName":"Sust Ag & Food Systems B S","name":"Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems B.S.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"228920130","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"228920130","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"At least 18 upper-division credits in the major must be taken at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus.\n<br>","editorEnabled":false}],"requisites":{"requisitesSimple":[{"id":"vMsYJRj1","name":"Sustainable Food Production","type":"Completion Requirement","showInCatalog":true,"position":0,"requirementLevel":"programSubPlanRequirements","rules":[{"id":"bRkveJrY","condition":"completeVariableCoursesAndVariableCredits","minCourses":6,"maxCourses":6,"minCredits":21,"maxCredits":22,"value":{"condition":"courses","values":[{"value":["0065781"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0076621"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8019271"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0078851","0054161"],"logic":"or"},{"value":["8014601"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8100051","7989311","0076511","0134061","8084941"],"logic":"or"}],"id":"xMui4C84","subSelections":[]},"name":"Required Courses"},{"id":"vdmAiIyA","condition":"minimumCredits","value":{"condition":"courses","values":[{"value":["8099781"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8253951"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8178521"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0076501"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8100051"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0076511"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0075891"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0128641"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0134061"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0066971"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8100331"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0023921"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8189481"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8263881"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8203051"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8140451"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["7989311"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["7975901"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8084941"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0125311"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8171341"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0077721"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["7948711"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8005951"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8021151"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8253461"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8257441"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8180541"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8171031"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["0076011"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["7995071"],"logic":"and"},{"value":["8195191","8195201","0141001","8195171","8195181"],"logic":"or"}],"id":"4Z2MKek1","subSelections":[]},"credits":13,"name":"Track Electives","description":"<p>Choose at least 13 credits from the following, of which at least 9 credits must be upper division  (3XXX or above)</p>"}],"notes":"<p>Students in this track will be prepared for jobs emerging in managing the relationship between plant-based food production systems and surrounding resource systems, including landscapes, waterways, and food and energy systems.

Through exploration of ancient literature, archaeological sites, artifacts, inscriptions, and manuscripts, students learn about major historical figures (e.g., Egyptian rulers, Alexander the Great, Cicero, Socrates and Plato, Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Roman Emperors, etc.), fascinating ancient literature (e.g., Homer's Iliad  and Odyssey, the Epic of Gilgemesh, Plato's Apology and Symposium, Euripides's Prometheus Bound and Bacchae, poetry by Catullus and Virgil, the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the Quran, etc.), and everyday ancient social realities (e.g., family, gender, status, economy, politics, agriculture, religious practice, sanctuaries, magic, etc.). You will also learn how to analyze ancient Mediterranean religions (Greek and Roman religion, ancient Israelite and Jewish religion, ancient Christianity and Islam). After some initial course requirements in one of several of our larger courses, students in the CNRC sub-plan take courses in three interrelated areas: State, Self, and Social Power; Literature and Intellectual History; and Religious Discourse, Authority, and Practice. Students in the Languages and Literature subplan take specific introductory courses and then can go on to study Greek, Latin, or Modern Hebrew. The field of classical and Near Eastern religions and cultures is at the root of many varied disciplines and careers from law and communications to non-profit work and administration. Any career that requires the skills of careful, critical analysis, deep research and understanding of cultural systems, and insight into the motivations of a plurality of religious perspectives active in the world today will benefit from this major. Our professors offer a collegial and friendly yet academically rigorous environment where you can grow in these skills and bring them to your current situation and future work.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Any second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":true,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Communications, Languages, and Cultural Studies","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"40","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"56","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Classics","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["10956"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10956"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10956","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}],"cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","reportAsNscProgram":true,"splitOwnership":false,"saaWhifDispAdvr":true,"saaWhifDispPrem":true,"saaWhifDispStd":true,"programLevelCareer":"Undergraduate"},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1139","hegisCode":"16.1200","id":"230720217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1706133932341,"lastEditedBy":"cumme017@umn.edu","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049756,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"CNRC B A","name":"Classical and Near Eastern Religions and Cultures B.A.","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"230720217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"230720217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"All CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

Services","cdProgramDescr":"The medical laboratory sciences BS degree program consists of two years of prerequisite courses and a two and a half year professional program sequence. Students are typically admitted to the professional program sequence after completing the prerequisites. Students may also be admitted directly into the final professional year after completion of the prerequisites and the upper division science requirements. Admission is once a year for the upcoming fall semester. The program uses an active learning hybrid program delivery format. Courses are offered through online modules, and other technology-enhanced delivery methods. Students then meet in person once per week for discussions, case studies, and problem solving exercises. The MLS program is fully accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS). \n\nThe program prepares students to be professional laboratory practitioners who are not only able to perform medical laboratory testing but analyze and critique the accuracy and validity of testing results for the improvement of patient care or research design. Graduates are eligible to take the American Society for Clinical Pathology Board of Certification examination and be certified as medical laboratory scientists. In addition to the medical laboratory setting, graduates of this program are qualified to work in a variety of other laboratory facilities such as research, environmental, biomedical, public health, or forensic laboratories. With the curriculum emphasis on developing quality understanding of laboratory methods and their diagnostic interpretation, our graduates are also excellent candidates for graduate research degree programs or graduate medical professional schools. Graduates of the MLS Program are also prepared to be leaders in healthcare delivery, medical laboratory professional societies, or as members of a research and development team. \n\nSince it began in 1922 as the first educational program for medical laboratory personnel, the MLS Program at the University of Minnesota has been a leader in the profession. Faculty in the program published the first article on quality control in the clinical laboratory, developed the first medical laboratory technician program, and established the first master's degree in clinical laboratory sciences. The program is proud to provide students with the opportunity to learn from faculty who focus on clinical excellence, critical thinking, analysis, evaluation, scientific inquiry, leadership, and professional and community service. Current faculty perform laboratory-based research as well as scholarship in the field of teaching and learning.

This major offers experience and education in support of many opportunities in health care business management. It provides practical instruction for undergraduates leading to entry-level administrative and management positions in hospitals, clinics, health care systems, medical offices, long-term care administration, home health, consulting, managed care, and many other related fields. Students will gain a conceptual understanding of business and the health care industry, along with analytical and problem-solving skills, to apply that knowledge in a variety of settings. The major's core content includes the following health care areas: leadership and management, equity, diversity and inclusion, quality management, health care economics and finance, legal and regulatory aspects, health informatics, human resources, medical ethics, and program evaluation. The major may be customized with electives in areas such as innovation, project management, long-term care administration, or health informatics, among others. An applied internship experience is required, along with a career planning course. The major will also interest individuals already employed in the industry who need additional skills for professional advancement. Finally, it can serve as excellent preparation for many graduate programs. The major builds upon the breadth, quality, and variety of courses in the CCAPS Health Services Management (HSM) and Applied Business (ABus) offerings as well as departmental courses through the School of Public Health, College of Liberal Arts, Institute of Health Informatics, and the Center for Spirituality and Healing, among others. \n\n","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"Hybrid","cdProgramDeliveryPrimaryHybridType":"Partially Online","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["Hybrid"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":["Partially Online"],"cdProgramDeliverySite":"Required internship activities are typically carried out in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, although internship sites outside of Minnesota are possible.

As a land grant institution, the University has a mission to contribute to the state's communities, and the major will help fulfill that mission. The department also prioritizes local American Indian community engagement and advocacy. One of the single best ways to create positive change within our communities is to instill pride and celebrate cultural traditions like language at an early age. What distinguishes this program from any other is our communication-centered approach based in storytelling and Dakota lifeways and knowledge in addition to using both academically rigorous grammatical instruction and immersion techniques inside the classroom. This method has proven to be a very powerful combination in helping our students reach a high level of proficiency in the Dakota language. Students who complete the program to attain this high proficiency will have the foundational skills to contribute to Dakota language community building by bringing the Dakota language back into the home, to go into the high-demand field of immersion teaching, and to work in language preservation programs. With this major, students will: \n\n1) Be more prepared to fill an ever-growing need for immersion teacher positions; 2) Graduate with a more sophisticated knowledge of the Dakota language in general; 3) Graduate with the prestige that comes of having earned a bachelor's degree in the Dakota language; 4) Have more time to increase their fluency under instructor supervision; 5) Increase their knowledge of immersion pedagogy; 6) Earn a bachelor's degree in the Dakota language (rather than a certificate) thereby increasing both their Dakota language credentials and earning potential upon graduation.","cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramAccredited":false,"cdProgramAdmissionCourseCreditMin":false,"cdProgramAdmissionPreMajorStatus":"No","cdProgramAdmissionGPACollAdmit":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATransIUT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGPATrans":false,"cdProgramAdmissionTOEFL":false,"cdProgramAdmissionIELTS":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGRE":false,"cdProgramAdmissionGMAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionMCAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionLSAT":false,"cdProgramAdmissionOtherTest":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"4","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"Specific second languages","cdProgramReqLanguageSpecific":"Dakota","cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"31","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Dakota Lng","cdDegreeGrantingCollege":"TCLA - College of Liberal Arts","cdProgramDeptBudgetOwner":["10948"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCLA - College of Liberal Arts"],"cdProgramDeptBudgetOwnerPercent":[{"deptId":"10948","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":true}]},"defaultOfRequirementTerm":"Plan's Declare Date","degreeDesignation":"202 - Bachelor of Arts","degreeDesignations":[],"degreeMaps":[],"delivery":"","departmentOwnership":[{"deptId":"TCLA","percentOwnership":100,"primaryDepartment":false}],"departments":["TCLA"],"description":"","diplomaDescription":"Bachelor of Arts","effectiveEndDate":null,"effectiveStartDate":"2023-09-05","evaluatePlanBeforeProgram":false,"fieldOfStudy":"","firstTermValid":"1229","hegisCode":"16.1001","id":"250220217-2023-09-05","institution":"UMNTC","institutionId":"","instructionalMethods":[],"lastAdmitTerm":"","lastEditedAt":1692180053246,"lastEditedBy":"$integration","lastProspectDate":"","lastSyncErrors":[],"lastSyncMergeReportId":"9TIXqgzHNVO8qWjQDMnT","lastSyncStatus":"success","lastSyncedAt":1692180049757,"learningOutcomes":[],"level":"17UGR College of Liberal Arts","longName":"Dakota Language B A","name":"Dakota Lng","notes":"","nscClassification":"B - Bachelor's Degree","owners":[],"printOnDiploma":true,"printOnTranscript":true,"programGroupId":"250220217","programLengthType":"Y","programLengthValue":4,"rawSisId":"250220217","registrationMode":"","requirementLevels":[{"key":"programRequirements","label":"Program Requirements","notes":"Students are required to complete 4 semester(s) of Dakota with a grade of C-, or better, or demonstrate proficiency in the language(s) as defined by the department or college.\n<br>\n<br>CLA BA degrees require 18 upper-division (3xxx-level or higher) credits outside the major designator.

In the Youth Studies program you will:\n Learn a myriad of theories about young people including: cultural, political, sociological, phenomenological, biopsychological, and historical perspectives of youth\n Identify and interrogate the ideas and ask increasingly complicated questions about young people and what is known about them\n Reflect on your own experiences of being a young person and your own youthhood\n Engage and learn about the everyday lives of youth\n Leave prepared to imagine and engage in a range of youthwork practices and professional spaces\n Graduate with a background in designing innovative youth interventions and evaluation and research methods to explore what these create for young people and the communities they live in\n\nYouth Studies students engage community through regular site visits, program observations, community-engaged learning, international exchanges, and internships. Students are supported by culturally competent academic advising and one-on-one student-elder partnerships with faculty, staff, or community leaders. Qualified graduates may pursue graduate study in fields such as: youth development leadership, social work, education, public policy, or nonprofit/ business management.\n\nProgram requirements for the majors at the College of Education and Human Development (CEHD) fulfill a number of the University's required liberal education (LE) cores and themes. Youth Studies students have multiple options for fulfilling LE requirements and are designed explicitly to align with CEHD's mission by providing foundational skill development and preparation for advanced coursework in youth studies.","cdProgramTypeManual":"Baccalaureate","cdProgramReqLanguageSemesters":"0","cdProgramReqLanguageUgrd":"No second language","cdProgramMastPlanA":false,"cdProgramMastPlanB":false,"cdProgramMastPlanBCap":false,"cdProgramMastPlanC":false,"cdProgramMastPlanCCap":false,"cdProgramGradMinor4xxx":false,"cdProgramReqLanguageGrad":false,"cdProgramDualDeg":false,"cdProgramMinorAllowed":false,"cdProgramReqSubplanGrad":false,"cdProgramReqSubplan":false,"cdProgramAcadExchange":false,"cdProgramSumTerms":false,"cdProgramFieldofStudy":"Social Sciences and Human Services","cdProgramDisplayCatalog":true,"cdProgramCreditsProgramMin":"60","cdProgramCreditsProgramMax":"63","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMin":"120","cdProgramCreditsDegreeMax":"120","cdProgramSubplanMoreThanOne":false,"cdProgramLengthInTermsUndergrad":"8","cdProgramMastPlanCHasFinEx":false,"cdProgramNameShort":"Youth Stud","cdProgramDeliveryAddl":["In-person/classroom"],"cdProgramDeliveryAddlHybridType":[],"cdProgramDeliveryPrimary":"In-person/classroom","cdProgramCareer":"Undergraduate","cdProgramDeptStakeholders":["11230"],"cdProgramCollegeStakeholders":["TCED -
