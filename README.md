# MmOverlap --> Gopher Major Planner
 A project from Social Coding Club at the University of Minnesota

I haven't connected backend to frontend yet.
Assuming that nobody has experience using react, node.js, or flask, start with these commands 
using gitbash or equivalent:

To run frontend:
1. cd MmOverlap
2. cd frontend
3. npm run dev
4. Go to http://localhost:5173/

To run backend-flask:
YOU MUST activate the virtual environment (step 2). Type "deactivate" to deactivate the virtual environment
1. cd MmOverlap
2. . .venv/Scripts/activate
3. cd backend-flask
4. flask run
5. Go to http://localhost:5000/

For frontend, the only files you want to pay attention to are App.css, Navbar.tsx, Footer.tsx, ProgressPage.tsx, LandingPage.tsx, CoursePage.tsx, and index.css
