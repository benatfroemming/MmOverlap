# MmOverlap
 A project from Social Coding Club at the University of Minnesota

I haven't connected backend to frontend yet. 
Assuming that nobody has experience using react or node.js, start with these commands 
using gitbash or equivalent:

To run frontend
1. cd MmOverlap
2. cd frontend
3. npm run dev
3. Go to http://localhost:5173/

To run backend
1. cd MmOverlap
2. cd backend
3. npm start
3. Go to http://localhost:3001/


For frontend the only files you want to pay attention to are App.css, App.tsx, ProgressPage.tsx, LandingPage.tsx, index.css, and CoursePage.tsx.
